## General info
Created by Colten Murray, Aldo Garcia Tovar, Isaiah Collins, Marcos Izaquirre Manet and Richard Hale, Battle Boats is a multiplayer
turn-based strategy game inspired by the popular board game Battleship. As per traditional Battleship rules player begin the game by
setting up ships on their individual sides of the game board. Once both sides are finished, the game begins and players take turns attacking the opposite side trying to hit an enemy ship. In our version of the game, the player will be able to move their ships inbetween turns depending on the ship's class. Also, differing ship classes will have individual ways in how they can attack the opposite side. The first player to lose all their ship loses! Our audience is anyone interested in killing some time with classic gameplay familiar to all age generations. Our goal is to recreate battleship into a more interactive version that is easier to play with your friends and hopefully capture some of the success experienced by other board game inspired web apps such as skribble.io, slither.io, and words with friends.
